# OptimizeMan: Gymcel

OptimizeMan: Gymcel is a life-sim, survival game built in Unreal Engine 5. 

Play as OptimizeMan, a regular guy grinding at the Hypermaxx Facility, where the pressure to level up physically and mentally slowly distorts reality.
## Core Gameplay

- **Muscle-Based Body Horror**\
  Push yourself too far and watch your body deform, tear, and snap. Every gain comes with a cost.

- **Mental Stat Survival System**\
  Your mental state directly affects gameplay, and survival odds.

- **Permadeath & Replayability**\
  Every run is a new attempt. New content and hidden moments reward different playstyles and paths.

- **Dynamic Difficulty**\
  Difficulty scales through consequences. Fail to meet your daily goals, and you'll spiral into harsher penalties and weirder realities.

- **Score Chasing**\
  Earn points for completing goals, and get your name high on the leaderboard.
